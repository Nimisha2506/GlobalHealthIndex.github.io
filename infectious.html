  <p id="abc">Infectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms — such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. 
    Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They're normally harmless or even helpful. But under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease. 
    They can be passed from person to person through body secretions, insects or other means.</p>

          The alveoli fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe</p>

        <p>Chickenpox, also known as varicella, 
          is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). 
          It results in characteristic skin rashes that forms small, itchy blisters</p>

    <h2 style="font-size: 30px; color: #ff84c1;">MALARIA</h2>
    <p>It is a single-celled parasite that multiplies amongst the red blood cells of humans as well as in the mosquito’s intestine.
      The parasites multiply in the mosquito’s gut and these infectious forms are passed onto another human when the mosquito feeds again.</p>
      <p><h4>CAUSE AND EFFECT:</h4> Malaria is caused by a type of microscopic parasite. The parasite is transmitted to humans most commonly through mosquito bites.
        A malaria infection is generally characterized by the following signs and symptoms: Fever, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting, and muscle pain and fatigue. </p>
    <p><h4>CURE/TREATMENT:</h4> Physicians administer the medication in pill form or as an intravenous antimalarial. The most commonly used medications are:<ul><li> chloroquine (Aralen), doxycycline (Vibramycin, Oracea, Adoxa, Atridox), quinine (Qualaquin), mefloquine, etc. </li>
    <li>RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) vaccine that acts against Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest malaria parasite globally</li></ul> </p>

      <p><h4>CURE/TREATMENT:</h4> There is no specific treatment for chickenpox, but there are pharmacy remedies that can alleviate symptoms. These include paracetamol to relieve fever, and calamine lotion and cooling gels to ease itching.</p>
      <p><h4>STATISTICS:</h4><ul><li>Chickenpox used to be very common in the United States. In the early 1990s, an average of 4 million people got varicella, 10,500 to 13,000 were hospitalized (range, 8,000 to 18,000), and 100 to 150 died each year.</li>
